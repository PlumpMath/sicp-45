;Eva's.(The footnote has the answer)
;Devising a way that works as eva proposed is difficult. Instead of doing scoping out sequentially with the procedures defined, it would mean we'd have to analyze each expression if it uses a variable defined in the same scope and postpone it's evaluation after the definitions it relies on have been evaluated. Not to mention recursive definitions that would further complicate the problem.
;As the footnote states, Alyssa's version might be the most practical.
