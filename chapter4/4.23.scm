;Let's analyze:
(begin (+ 1 1))

;The text's version does more of the work because it analyzes the sequence itself at analysis time so that come time of execution analysis of the sequence itself isn't required. After handing the env everything happens by itself. Wheras alyssa's version goes through the sequence at execution.
