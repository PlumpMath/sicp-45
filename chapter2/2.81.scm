;a) an endless loop
;   Had there been an operation defined for complex numbers the procedure, upon execution, wouldn't reach the coercion logic.
;   However with no such operation, apply-generic keeps on recursing endlessly with one number being constantly coerced.
;b) Coercion with arguments of the same type is not necessary because unless an operation is defined coercing one number is nothing more than trying to execute the operation over and over again, when the operation is not defined resulting in an endless loop
